- âœ… Intelligent caching with TTL and performance metrics
- âœ… Comprehensive setup script with auto-configuration
- âœ… Acceptance rate tracking and error rate monitoring
- âœ… Prediction logging and diagnostics
- âœ… Cache management and configuration persistence
- âœ… Model pre-warming to eliminate first-use latency

**Current Development Phase:**
- ðŸ”§ JSON-first reliability improvements
- ðŸ”§ SSH tunnel robustness enhancements

## Key Architecture

### PowerAuger Prediction Engine (PowerAuger.psm1:1-1131)
1. **Intelligent Model Selection**: Automatically switches between fast and context-aware models based on input complexity
2. **Advanced Context Engine**: Environment awareness (git, files, directory state, elevation, command history)
3. **SSH Tunnel Management**: Secure connections to remote Ollama servers with background process management
4. **Performance Tracking**: Comprehensive metrics including acceptance rates, error rates, and latency monitoring
5. **Intelligent Caching**: TTL-based caching with size management and performance optimization
6. **Fallback Systems**: History-based suggestions when AI models are unavailable
7. **State Persistence**: Configuration and history stored in `~/.PowerAuger/` directory
8. **Model Pre-warming**: Background jobs warm models at startup to eliminate first-use latency

### Model Selection Strategy
- **Simple completions** (<10 chars, no complex context) â†’ powershell-fast:latest model
- **Complex completions** (parameters, file paths, pipelines) â†’ powershell-context:latest model
- **Timeout handling**: 30-second timeouts for custom models
- **Fallback logic**: History-based suggestions when models fail

### Metrics and Monitoring
- **Acceptance Tracking**: Monitors which predictions are actually used by users
- **Error Rate Tracking**: Tracks when accepted predictions result in command failures
- **Performance Metrics**: Request latency, cache hit rates, success rates
- **Prediction Logging**: Optional detailed logging of all predictions for troubleshooting

## Development Notes

### Testing and Benchmarking
- Use `Benchmark-PowerAuger.ps1` to test model performance and acceptance rates
- Performance targets: Fast model <300ms, Context model <1000ms, Acceptance rate >30%
- Benchmark includes statistical analysis and model comparison

### Configuration Management
- Configuration stored in `~/.PowerAuger/config.json`
- SSH tunnel configuration in `$global:OllamaConfig.Server`
- Model parameters match Modelfile specifications (temperature: 0.1-0.4, top_p: 0.8-0.85)
- Context providers are extensible via `$global:ContextProviders` registry

### Model Integration
- Models use different prompt templates: Fast uses "INPUT:", Context uses "CONTEXT: pwd=..., files=[...], command=..."
- Models output line-separated text, not JSON (except PowerShell-Completion)
- Custom model compatibility with intelligent timeout handling
- Model pre-warming via background jobs in `Initialize-OllamaPredictor` (PowerAuger.psm1:1000-1032)

### Setup and Installation
- Interactive `setup.ps1` script handles complete configuration
- Auto-detects SSH keys and available models
- Configures PowerShell profile for auto-loading
- Tests connectivity and provides diagnostics

## PowerShell Profile Integration

- PowerAuger auto-initializes with SSH tunnel management
- Profiles include synthwave theming alongside AI prediction capabilities
- `profile.ps1` handles conda environment setup if available
- Auto-loader added to `$PROFILE` for seamless integration
