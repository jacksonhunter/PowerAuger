# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Overview

This is **PowerAuger v3.4.0+** - a production-ready Ollama PowerShell Predictor with AI-powered command completion, intelligent model selection, advanced context awareness, and comprehensive metrics tracking. The repository has been **reorganized into a clean, modular structure** with separate directories for source code, scripts, tests, and legacy components.

## Project Reorganization (2025)

### New Directory Structure
The project has been completely reorganized from a flat structure to a hierarchical, modular organization:

```

### Key Changes Made
- **Source Consolidation**: Core PowerAuger module moved to `src/`
- **Script Organization**: Setup and configuration scripts moved to `scripts/setup/`
- **Test Centralization**: All testing moved to `tests/integration/`
- **Legacy Preservation**: Historical components moved to `legacy/` (untracked)
- **Continue Reintegration**: Continue IDE support reorganized as configuration generator

## Current Status & Next Priorities

### Immediate Development Tasks

1. **Continue IDE Integration Modernization**
   - Status: Continue support moved to `scripts/setup/continue/` as config generator
   - Task: Update `New-ContinueConfiguration.ps1` for new project structure
   - Need: Decision on new model strategy for Continue IDE compatibility

2. **Model Strategy Evaluation**
   - Current: Legacy modelfiles in `legacy/modelfiles/` (5 PowerShell + 2 Python models)
   - Decision Needed: Which models to modernize vs. create minimal modelfiles
   - Focus: Determine active model set for dynamic prompt building

3. **Dynamic Prompt Building Function**
   - Purpose: Adaptive prompt construction for active models
   - Integration: Works with current intelligent model selection system
   - Target: Enhanced context awareness and prediction relevance

4. **OllamaTunnelMonitor Development**
   - Status: Backup in `legacy/OllamaTunnelMonitor-Backup/`
   - Goal: Complete standalone tunnel monitoring module
   - Features: Real-time dashboard, headless monitoring, auto-import

5. **Roadmap Updates**
   - Reflect reorganization in project planning
   - Update installation paths and documentation
   - Align with new modular architecture

- Dynamic prompt building for active models
- OllamaTunnelMonitor completion
- Model evaluation and minimal modelfile decisions

**Short-Term Goals (v3.5.x):**

- Enterprise integration features

## Key Architecture (Updated for New Structure)

### Core PowerAuger Engine (src/PowerAuger.psm1:1-3000+)
1. **Intelligent Model Selection**: Automatically switches between fast and context-aware models based on input complexity
2. **Advanced Context Engine**: Environment awareness (git, files, directory state, elevation, command history)
3. **SSH Tunnel Management**: Secure connections to remote Ollama servers with background process management
4. **Performance Tracking**: Comprehensive metrics including acceptance rates, error rates, and latency monitoring
5. **Intelligent Caching**: TTL-based caching with size management and performance optimization
6. **Fallback Systems**: History-based suggestions when AI models are unavailable
7. **State Persistence**: Configuration and history stored in `~/.PowerAuger/` directory
8. **Model Pre-warming**: Background jobs warm models at startup to eliminate first-use latency

### Model Strategy (Needs Evaluation)
**Current Legacy Models** (in `legacy/modelfiles/`):
- PowerShell-Fast.Modelfile (qwen3:4b-q4_K_M, <300ms target)
- PowerShell-Context.Modelfile (Advanced context-aware completion)
- PowerShell-Completion.Modelfile (JSON-structured for Continue IDE)
- PowerShell-Adaptive.Modelfile (Learning model)
- PowerShell-Chat.Modelfile (Conversational assistance)
- Python-Chat.Modelfile, Python-Completion.Modelfile

**Decision Required**: Which models to modernize vs. create minimal modelfiles for current needs.

### Model Selection Strategy (Current Implementation)
- **Simple completions** (<10 chars, no complex context) â†’ powershell-fast:latest model
- **Complex completions** (parameters, file paths, pipelines) â†’ powershell-context:latest model
- **Timeout handling**: 30-second timeouts for custom models
- **Fallback logic**: History-based suggestions when models fail

### Metrics and Monitoring
- **Acceptance Tracking**: Monitors which predictions are actually used by users
- **Error Rate Tracking**: Tracks when accepted predictions result in command failures
- **Performance Metrics**: Request latency, cache hit rates, success rates
- **Prediction Logging**: Optional detailed logging of all predictions for troubleshooting

## Development Guidelines (Updated Paths)

### Testing and Benchmarking
- **Location**: `tests/integration/`
- **Main Scripts**: 
  - `Benchmark-PowerAuger.ps1` - Performance and acceptance rate testing
  - `Daily-PowerAuger-Tests.ps1` - Automated testing suite
  - `Test-PowerAugerTracking.ps1` - Metrics validation
- **Performance Targets**: Fast model <300ms, Context model <1000ms, Acceptance rate >30%

### Configuration Management
- **Core Module**: `src/PowerAuger.psm1` and `src/PowerAuger.psd1`
- **Setup Script**: `scripts/setup/setup.ps1`
- **User Config**: `~/.PowerAuger/config.json`
- **SSH Config**: `$global:OllamaConfig.Server`
- **Model Parameters**: Match legacy Modelfile specifications (temperature: 0.1-0.4, top_p: 0.8-0.85)

### Continue IDE Integration (Modernized)
- **Location**: `scripts/setup/continue/`
- **Generator**: `New-ContinueConfiguration.ps1`
- **Purpose**: Generate `config.json` files for Continue IDE
- **Status**: Needs updating for new model strategy and project structure
- **Integration**: Compatible with PowerAuger's model selection system

### Installation Process (Updated Paths)
1. Clone repository
2. Run `scripts/setup/setup.ps1` for guided configuration
3. Auto-detection of SSH keys and available models
4. PowerShell profile configuration for auto-loading
5. Connectivity testing and diagnostics

### Development Workflow
- **Source Code**: All core development in `src/`
- **Scripts**: Setup and configuration in `scripts/`
- **Testing**: Integration tests in `tests/integration/`
- **Legacy**: Historical components preserved in `legacy/` (untracked)
- **Documentation**: Centralized in `scripts/setup/continue/` for now

## Next Steps for Development

1. **Update Continue IDE Generator**: Modernize `New-ContinueConfiguration.ps1` for new structure
2. **Model Strategy Decision**: Evaluate legacy models and determine active set
3. **Dynamic Prompt Building**: Implement adaptive prompt construction
4. **OllamaTunnelMonitor**: Complete standalone module from backup
5. **Path Updates**: Update all references to use new directory structure
